# Supply-chain-Demand-Forecasting-and-Analysis-Platform
This is a modular demand-forecasting backend that predicts daily customer orders at customer × product × city granularity. It combines internal history with external context (e.g., promotions, inventory days, sell-outs) and returns both row-level predictions and summary statistics for analytics, planning, and downstream BI.
